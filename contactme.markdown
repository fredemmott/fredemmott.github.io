## Help with my personal projects

I create and work on my personal projects for my own use, and I share
them in the hope others find them useful; I'm not able to commit to
support, bug fixes, or feature development.

Support may be available from the communities [via Discord](https://discord.gg/QQhzk782EV).


I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means; this includes GitHub,
Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.
