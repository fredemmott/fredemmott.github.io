I'm Fred; I'm an American and British software engineer, living in Texas.

My work has recently been focussed on XR, programming language
and standard library design, and I've also spent time working
on Open Source, tools to help coworkers be more efficient,
privacy, and security.

My personal projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fredemmott), and tend
to be focussed on OpenXR, or convenience/utilities.
