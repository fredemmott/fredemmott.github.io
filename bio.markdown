I'm Fred; I'm an American and British software engineer, living in Texas.

My recent work has been focussed on XR, and I am an invidual member of the Khronos OpenXR Working Group, as an Invited Expert. My earlier career has been focussed on  programming language and standard library design, corporate-managed open source, tools to help coworkers be more efficient, and to improve privacy and security.

My personal projects are [on GitHub](https://github.com/fredemmott), and tend
to be focussed on OpenXR, or developer convenience/utilities.
